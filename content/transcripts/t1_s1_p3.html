        <p>Myself being a woman and working in an organisation…I think it’s so good that we don’t just, I suppose, treat women equally, but also celebrate diversity and the different opinions and strengths that men and women bring to the workplace.</p>

        <p>The perfect world for a transgender person is where we don’t get that look anymore. Oh…if looks could kill, oh my goodness! I would be so dead so many times.</p>

        <p>With my disability, I thought it would be very hard to be part of the family straight away. I thought I had to prove myself — that I could do, I could do, what everyone else can, even with my disability making it ten times harder to do day-to-day chores, such as tying my shoelace, going for walks…but I was completely wrong. They took me with open arms and made me who I am today.</p>

        <p>As inclusivity's, like, one of our really important values…that we do acknowledge country when we have meetings and acknowledging that there is traditions that are older than us and that were here before us that are really important to where we live and where we work. </p>

        <p>It's about, you know, embracing and welcoming people in. Spending time with someone who cares for country and also open to share it — not only with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but for non-Aboriginal people. And I think this is so powerful.</p>
