        <p>At myHR, we sometimes have reports of alleged inappropriate physical contact. Unfortunately, some staff think that it’s OK to knowingly invade someone’s personal space without invitation. It isn’t.</p>

        <p>Regardless of what workplace cultures may have historically accepted, today we do all we can to make you feel comfortable and safe at work — this includes preventing any physical behaviour that makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>When you raise a concern, it’s taken seriously. We investigate the circumstance fairly, we give those involved an opportunity to clearly be heard and supported, and we consider all the information, and then we make any necessary changes.</p>
        <p>As important as actually fixing these issues, is that you feel comfortable to bring them to our attention and understand that you work in a place where inappropriate behaviour is dealt with properly.</p>

        <p>Too often we see cases where employees make racist comments towards their colleagues. Either to get a reaction out of them or as a joke. </p>

        <p>Regardless of that individual’s intention, it’s reasonable to expect that the person would be offended by such a comment…and not just the person who the comment is directed towards, but also to anyone who overhears comments of this nature. We’ve also seen the impact that this type of behaviour can have on individuals in their personal lives &mdash; in particular on their mental health and their wellbeing. </p>

        <p>Too many times the profound impact these words can have on people’s lives and mental health, such as <strong>[***insert a couple of examples***]</strong>.</p>
        <p>An example of this is where a nickname has been used overtime and then bit by bit this can have a significant impact on an individual of a particular culture or background and particularly as we see society progressing, these types of culturally insensitive words or phrases are no longer acceptable or condoned. </p>
        <p>We investigate these matters fairly and we take necessary steps to resolve them, which, in the past, has led to the termination of employment.

        <p>It’s never ok to make racist comments in the workplace. At Australia Post, we do not condone harassment, discrimination or bullying of any kind, and we encourage and support you to stand up and call out inappropriate behaviour.</p>
