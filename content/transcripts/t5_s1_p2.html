<p>At myHR, we sometimes have reports of alleged inappropriate physical contact. Unfortunately, some staff think that it’s OK to knowingly invade someone’s personal space without invitation. It isn’t.</p>
<p>Regardless of what workplace cultures may have historically accepted, today we do all we can to make you feel comfortable and safe at work — this includes preventing any physical behaviour that makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>When you raise a concern, it’s taken seriously.</p>
<ul class="list-style-1">
    <li>We investigate the circumstance fairly</li>
    <li>We give those involved an opportunity to clearly be heard and supported</li>
    <li>We consider all the information, and then we make any changes necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>As important as actually fixing these issues, is that you feel comfortable to bring them to our attention and understand that you work in a place where inappropriate behaviour is dealt with properly.</p>
<p>Too often we have cases where employees have made racist comments to someone as a joke or to get a reaction. Other people overhear the comment and are offended, or it’s had more of an effect on the person it was directed at than intended. We’ve seen too many times the profound impact these words can have on people’s lives and mental health, such as [insert a couple of examples].</p>
<p>We always investigate these matters fairly and take necessary steps to resolve them, which, in the past, has led to termination of employment.</p>
<p>It’s never ok to make racist comments in the workplace. At Australia Post, we don’t tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying of any kind, and we encourage and support you to stand up and call out inappropriate behaviour.</p>
