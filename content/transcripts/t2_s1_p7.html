        <p>We had a customer who was angry because his LPO, the closest one, had closed down some time ago. He was angry because he didn’t want to have to come in and pick up his parcel…and he was angry because he thought this parcel should have been delivered by the contractor.</p>

    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>While he was standing in the queue, he started making comments to the couple of customers we already had there. They were obscene. They were offensive. They were quite lude. They were very, very horrible comments directed to these customers.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>I heard him being very loud and swearing at my staff members, so I had to go out and intervene.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>So we discussed his parcel and I agreed that I would take up what had happened with our delivery people and he was relatively happy with that. He shook my hand and then he left.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>But we still had very shaken staff, a couple of distressed customers…so with the staff, we actually talked about what had happened several times over the next few days.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>We talked about what worked, what didn’t help, what we could have done, and what we would have done if it had have escalated.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="transcript-text">
        <p>And because of the way it all panned out and the way we handled it, my staff and our customers are really confident and feel very safe in the fact that if such an incident were to happen again, we know we can handle it.</p>
