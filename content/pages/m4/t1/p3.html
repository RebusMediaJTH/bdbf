                <p>When working with our partners, we need to make sure that any of our relationships, activities or interests outside of APG don't influence or might be seen by others to influence any decisions that we make. These are called 'conflicts of interest'.</p>
                <p>Conflicts of interest  can also occur when working with partners when:</p>
                <ul class="icon-list tick white">
                    <li>You, or a family member or close personal friend holds a direct interest in a business or organisation we partner with, and</li>
                    <li>You stand to generate a personal gain for yourself or a family member, or a close personal friend.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We need to avoid conflicts of interest and receiving or giving gifts, benefits and hospitality that can affect our decision-making or the way others might perceive our decision-making.</p>
