                <div class="audio-control outset" data-audio-file="t2_s4_p2"></div>
                <p>Just after the Christmas and New Year's break I suffered a mental health episode.</p>
                <p>To help me get back to work sooner, my manager and I discussed the tasks I normally did and we worked with some of my team members to redesign my role temporarily. We made it so my interactions with customers were minimised until I felt better able to deal with the range of emotions that type of work can involve.</p>

                <p>We all work hard at work so I was a little concerned that some of my team members might not understand the reasons behind the changes to my role. I didn't want a misunderstanding to make me a target for comments and rumours.</p>
                <p>I brought this up with my manager and she suggested we arrange a team meeting to ensure everyone understood my circumstances. I was OK with that so long as we didn't go into the details of my condition.</p>
                <p>We had the meeting on my first day back and I was blown away by the support and understanding from my team. It was a huge relief.</p>

                <p>Later that year, the relationship I had been in had become quite stressful. It wasn't until someone at work noticed something was up and asked me if I was OK that I just broke down and opened up about what was going on.</p>
                <p>I was in denial, I didn't want to face it and I was so embarrassed by it all. So my co-worker spoke with my manager confidentially and came back and told me that I should discuss it with someone who may be able to help.</p>
                <p>I was able to access leave which gave me the time to move out and find a new place. I honestly don't know how I would have done it without the support I got at work.</p>
