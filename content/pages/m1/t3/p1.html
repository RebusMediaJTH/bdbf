            <h2>Meet Andre</h2>
            <p>He’s smart, charming, well-spoken, and he has a lovely family who’s involved in the community.</p>
            <p>What you don’t see, is that Andre’s tried over 500 times to gain access to the Australia Post network to take and sell highly confidential customer information, including credit card details. Breaking into our network isn’t easy, so Andre’s looking for a simpler way — like sending an email to trick someone into gaining him access.</p>
            <p>You’re the first line of defence against people like Andre. So, what can you do?</p>

        <h2>Social engineering</h2>
        <p>It isn’t just online tactics that cyber criminals use to try and gain access to our networks. Consider the following real-life scenario.</p>
        <p>You receive a call instore. The woman on the line says she is from Telstra and tells you that due to high volumes of emails and social media messages being sent through the AP network, the internet service will be disconnected. She starts walking you through steps at your computer to check the network activity.</p>

                        <p>Good thinking. Once you ask for details, the scammer will likely end the call. Always remain alert — just because they give you details, doesn’t mean they’re genuine. Tell the caller you’ll contact our Helpdesk and pass the information on for their follow-up, then end the call and escalate the incident immediately.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-response="incorrect">
                        <p>Not quite. It’s best to ask some questions first. If the caller is a scammer, they’re unlikely to give you information and may end the call themselves. Transferring them or asking them to call another number may result in them targeting another unsuspecting team member.</p>
