            <ul class="list-style-1">
              <li>use abusive, insulting or offensive language</li>

            <p>It’s not bullying if a supervisor or manager directs someone’s work or conducts a performance or behaviour conversation with someone — that’s their job. As long as the supervisor or manager communicates the directive in line with the minimum behavioural expectations outlined in Our Ethics, they are doing things the right way.</p>
