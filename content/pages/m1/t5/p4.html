            <h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
            <p>You’re more than likely bullying someone or a group of people if you:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-1">
              <li>use abusive, insulting or offensive language</li>
              <li>spread misinformation or rumours</li>
              <li>use frightening behaviour</li>
              <li>criticise via yelling</li>
              <li>make jokes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And it:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-1">
              <li>happens more than once</li>
              <li>is obvious to most people that you’re victimising, humiliating or threatening.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It’s not bullying if a supervisor or manager directs someone’s work or conducts a performance or behaviour conversation with someone &mdash; that’s their job. As long as the supervisor or manager communicates the directive in line with the minimum behavioural expectations outlined in Our Ethics, they are doing things the right way.</p>

                      <p>It’s important to be able to distinguish between someone performing their role requirements, someone speaking up about poor behaviour and someone who is bullying. Excluding a team member from an activity or denying them time off is not the same as conducting performance or behaviour discussions. One is part of the job while the others are actively victimising.</p>
