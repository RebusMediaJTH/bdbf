            <h2>What is discrimination?</h2>
            <p>You’re more than likely discriminating if you’re treating a person or group of people unfairly or less favourably than others because of their sex, race, disability, age or some other trait. It’s important to note that unreasonable discriminating behaviours aren’t just limited to this list.</p>
            <p>Discrimination can even occur if you don’t intend to discriminate.</p>
            <p>Consider the following situation.</p>

                <p>You’re recruiting for a position in your team. The role is fast paced, challenging and sometimes requires working long hours. Andrea and Gabrielle are internal applicants for the role. Andrea has a husband and three young children who are in day care and school; Gabrielle has a partner, but no children.</p>

                <p>While you’ve worked with both women before, Andrea’s experience is more suited to the role and she’s performed more highly in her current role; however, you’re concerned that her family responsibilities might impact her ability to meet the demands of this new role.

                <p>Discrimination can be direct or indirect. Since you’ve only been given information about Andrea and Gabrielle’s personal circumstances, making your rostering decision based solely on this would be a form of discrimination. To make a fair decision, you’d need to consider things such as who’s worked more holiday periods, who’s taken more leave in the past twelve months, or who submitted their leave request first.</p>

            <h2>What is racial vilification?</h2>
            <p>Racial vilification can include:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-1">
              <li>gestures</li>
              <li>racist jokes — including jokes based on racial stereotypes</li>
              <li>offensive comments, and</li>
              <li>making decisions based on a person’s race that may offend or humiliate them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An example of this could include denying someone access to cultural leave, even though they’re entitled to take it.
            <p>It’s unlawful to do anything that is reasonably likely to insult, humiliate, offend or intimidate someone based on their race, colour, national or ethnic origin. It’s also a breach of the HDB Policy and Our Ethics. </p>
            <p>Your actions can still amount to racial vilification even if you didn’t intend to insult, humiliate, offend or intimidate the other person.</p>
