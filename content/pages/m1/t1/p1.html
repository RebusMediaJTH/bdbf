                <p>Discrimination, harassment, bullying, violence and anything that creates a safety hazard can get you into trouble with the law. If you're a Manager or Supervisor, your responsibility is even greater to keep your workplace free of these behaviours - it's important that you lead by example, looking out for incidents of harassment, discrimination or bullying in the workplace and taking appropriate action when you see them.</p>
                <p>Any complaints will be investigated promptly and fairly.</p>
