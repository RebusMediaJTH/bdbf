          <p>Sharon is deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other. </p>
          <p>While you can’t tell from looking at her, for Sharon to be able to communicate in the weekly team meetings, she needs a meeting room with a hearing loop so that she can connect her hearing aid. She also needs to be able to see people’s faces so that she can lip read.</p>
          <p>Last week, instead of the usual sit-down discussion in the meeting room, Sharon’s team organised a morning tea in the lunchroom to celebrate a birthday. Everyone was free to walk around, chat and eat.</p>
          <p><strong>Select</strong> Play to join in the celebrations.</p>

          <p>Couldn’t hear anything? Neither could we. That’s what it’s like for Sharon when her team doesn’t consider her needs when organising team events.</p>
          <p>Day-to-day activities that you take for granted might not work for everyone in your team. To have an inclusive environment, you need to consider and respect everyone’s needs. Before you do something, think — is this going to work for everyone in my team?</p>
