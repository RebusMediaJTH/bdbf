00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.750
Going past the shops or your neighbours' homes on the way home from work 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.500
is an everyday reminder that we live together in communities.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Getting out and about on the weekend can put us back in touch with the natural environment.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
But what about at work?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.400
How does the work we do fit in with the world we see around us?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.000
Few Australian organisations are as embedded in the community as we are.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.500
And the size of our business means our impact on the environment can be substantial.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.300
Being a large organisation, we have a special responsibility to the world around us.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
As a member of our team, it's up to you to make sure that you act in-line with 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.500
Our Values, Our Ethics, and within any laws or regulations.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.800
And, just to make sure you're clear on this, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.500
you'll get training at just the right time

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.200
with just the right amount of information to help you understand what you can expect from us, 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.800
and what we expect from you.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.200
You can also read about these in a series of policy documents on our Corporate Intranet site.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.300
If you're unable to access the Corporate Intranet, talk to your People Leader.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.800
We want to support you to make better decisions in the work you do every day,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:001:23.500
so that our business continues to be a great place to work and the customers we serve leave with a smile.
