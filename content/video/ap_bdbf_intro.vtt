00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.360
Every single little thing you do today is the result of the decisions you make.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.360
How do you know when you're making the best choices?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.700
Well... if you're like most of us... you'll have your own standards that you live by.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.900
You probably know a lot about what's expected of you from your interactions with the people closest to you.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
You also know what to do when a stranger asks for help, right?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
There's a good chance you already know how to do your bit in 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.100
protecting our community and the natural resources we depend on.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.000
And you definitely know who you want to work with when you need to get the job done,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.500
because you know what's required to keep your household running smoothly.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200
And even when you don't know what to do,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
you know where to go for help in figuring it out... Right?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.100
Right. Because everything you do is about creating a better future for yourself and those who rely on you,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600
and doing it in a way that you can be proud of.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.500
Same goes for all of us at the Australia Post Group.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.200
Every day we're interacting and working together to create a great culture. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
We're helping our customers and meeting their changing expectations.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.500
We're out in the community, embracing our responsibilities to the world around us.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
We're collaborating with our partners and driving innovation in this digital age.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.600
And we're putting our foot down to accelerate our business so we can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600
deliver a better future for everyone, everywhere.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.900
We do all of this in a way that is ethical and consistent with Our Values.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.400
It all comes down to the things we do and the decisions we make, every day.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.000
What part will you play?
