WEBVTT

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.100
Being one of Australia's largest businesses doesn't mean we work alone.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.400
We work together with hundreds of other businesses,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.600
community interest groups, and government agencies and regulatory bodies.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.750
Our success depends on these relationships.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.550
As a member of the Australia Post Group team, it's up to you to make sure that you act in-line with Our Values,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.300
Our Ethics, and within any laws or regulations.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.650
And, just to make sure you're clear on this, 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
you'll get training at just the right time with just the right amount of information 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.100
to help you understand what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.300
You can also read about these in a series of policy documents on our Corporate Intranet site.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.350
Refer to your People Leader if you don't have access to the Corporate Intranet. 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.500
We want to support you to make better decisions in the work you do every day,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.000
so that our business continues to be a great place to work and the customers we serve leave with a smile.
