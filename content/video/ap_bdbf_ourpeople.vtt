WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.300
Our people are the heart of our business.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.000
Coming from a range of backgrounds and personal experiences,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.100
and celebrating an amazing range of skills and interests, 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.400
we work in teams that are as diverse as the communities in which we live.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Working together means helping each other, respecting each other and communicating with each other

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.200
to deliver the best possible outcomes for our customers, our partners and the community,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.400
and to ensure a safe, healthy and productive workplace.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As a member of our team, it's up to you to make sure that how you act towards your co-workers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.600
team members and people leaders is in-line with Our Values,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.900
Our Ethics, and with any laws or regulations.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.200
And, just to make sure you're clear on this, you'll get training at just the right time

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.500
with just the right amount of information to help you understand what you can expect from us,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.600
and what we expect from you. 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.200
You can also read about these in a series of policy documents on our Corporate Intranet site.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.500
If you are unable to access the corporate intranet

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.200
talk to your people leader.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.300
We want to support you to make better decisions in the work you do every day,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.100
so that our business continues to be a great place to work and the customers we serve,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.000
leave with a smile.
