Who's that guy? 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.600
That's Carl. We all know Carl.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200
Or do we?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.200
Why is Carl behaving the way he does some days? He looks distracted, like something has upset him.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.500
Is he OK?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.600
Should I be concerned?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.500
He wasn't pay attention and almost caused an accident yesterday.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.200
I wonder what's going on with Carl?
