WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.500
We all have a responsibility to our stakeholders.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.500
For my team, our 'stakeholders' include our local community and its representatives. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.500
We engage Council when making changes to how we manage traffic coming in 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.500
and out of the Delivery Centre, and also when changing our waste management processes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Other stakeholders are our workers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.500
We're constantly on the lookout for ways to improve and happy to hear from anyone with a bright idea.
