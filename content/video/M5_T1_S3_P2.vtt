Fraud and corruption can happen at any level of our business.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Take the example of Genevieve. She works in a junior administrative role at our head office.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Feeling ill on August 9, she leaves work early and visits her local doctor

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500
who suggests she rest at home for a couple of days.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.500
The doctor provides Genevieve with a certificate stating she is unable to work from August 9 until August 11.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.500
On the morning of August 12 Genevieve still feels too ill to go to work.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Instead of going back to the doctor she alters the date on the doctor's certificate from August 11 to August 14

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500
and hands it in to her People Leader when she returns to work on August 13.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Genevieve believes she hasn't done anything seriously wrong because if she had gone back to the doctor

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
he would have given her another certificate anyway.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
How would you describe Genevieve's actions?
