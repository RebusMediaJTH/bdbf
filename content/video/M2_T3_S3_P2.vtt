00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.600
What would you do if a friend asked you to handle a large sum of money on their behalf?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.860
Of course you'd want to help a friend, but you'd probably have a few questions.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.280
Like most people, if your friend's response caused you to be suspicious of their activity, 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.600
you'd want to avoid being involved in anything that broke the law or caused harm in our community, right?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.400
This is the reality that faces us every day. Because we handle certain financial transactions,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.100
there's a risk our services could be used to launder money or process funds intended to finance acts of terrorism.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.900
Money laundering is the process criminals use to convert funds obtained from illegal activities

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
into legitimate assets or funds.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.600
Terrorism financing includes the financing of terrorist acts and terrorist organisations.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.460
It includes recklessly providing or collecting funds which may be used to facilitate or engage in a terrorist act.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.600
As a community we stand against these types of criminal activity

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.850
and this is reflected in Australian laws.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.450
These laws have been developed to help protect our nation,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.200
its people and our friends around the world by enabling organisations such as ours

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.600
to work alongside Government agencies in preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.800
This legislation requires us to play a vital role.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.050
We make sure people are who they say they are,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.600
we report certain transactions and we keep appropriate records.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.000
These responsibilities are formalised in our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF) policy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We've also appointed an AML/CTF Compliance Officer whose job it is to help ensure we're doing what's required of us.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.500
But the most important person to ensure we meet our obligations is YOU.
