00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Our customers are at the centre of everything we do.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
They've been relying on us for over 200 years

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.400
and we've been right there with them, adapting to a changing world, 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.300
always improving, and meeting our customers' ever-changing needs.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.500
Our business is built on the trust of our customers.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.750
Our customers trust us to provide quality products and services.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.300
They trust us to protect their privacy and all of their Personal Information we handle.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.900
They trust us to compete fairly in the marketplace 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.400
and to treat consumers with courtesy and respect.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
As a member of our team,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500
it's up to you to make sure that how you act towards our customers

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.700
is in-line with Our Values, Our Ethics, and with any laws or regulations. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
And, just to make sure you're clear on this,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.280
you'll get training at just the right time

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.000
with just the right amount of information to help you understand what you can expect from us, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
and what we expect from you.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.500
You can also read about these in a series of policy documents on our Corporate Intranet site.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.700
If you're unable to access the Corporate Intranet, talk to your People Leader.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
We want to support you to make better decisions in the work you do every day,  

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.900
so that our business continues to be a great place to work  

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.500
and the customers we serve leave with a smile.
