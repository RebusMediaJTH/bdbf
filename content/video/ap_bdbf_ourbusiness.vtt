00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.500
The success of our business relies on all of our people working to create shared value for our business

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.500
and for the Australian community.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.500
This module will provide you with a window to some of the behind-the-scenes work that supports our front line people

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
and sustains our business into the future.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.500
As a member of our team, it's up to you to make sure that you act in-line with Our Values,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Our Ethics, and within any laws or regulations. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.500
And, just to make sure you're clear on this, you'll get training at just the right time

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500
with just the right amount of information to help you understand what you can expect from us,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.500
and what we expect from you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
You can also read about these in a series of policy documents on the Corporate Intranet site.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.500
If you're unable to access the Corporate Intranet, talk to your People Leader. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.000
We want to support you to make better decisions in the work you do every day, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so that our business continues to be a great place to work 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the customers and businesses we serve, leave with a smile.
